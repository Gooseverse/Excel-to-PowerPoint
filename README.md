## Enhance Security

Ensuring the security and privacy of user data is paramount. Consider implementing the following security features to safeguard your application:

- **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Introduce user authentication to control access to the conversion functionality. Define authorization roles to restrict user actions.

- **Secure File Uploads:** Apply thorough file validation, allowing only specific file types. Implement regular security checks to prevent uploading of malicious files.

- **HTTPS (SSL/TLS):** Enforce HTTPS to encrypt data transmission, protecting user data from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Set up a content security policy to define trusted content sources and mitigate XSS vulnerabilities.

- **Regular Updates and Patching:** Keep backend libraries and frameworks up to date to address known vulnerabilities and maintain security.

- **Secure APIs:** If your application exposes APIs, secure them with authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and misuse.

- **Server Hardening:** Follow best practices for server configuration, firewall rules, and system updates to strengthen your server's security.
